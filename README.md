# Weather App

This is a weather app that fetches weather data based on country or City name or user's current location using OpenWeatherMap API.

## How to Run Locally

1. **Download or clone the project files** to your computer.
2. **Open the project folder** in a code editor (such as Visual Studio Code).
3. **Install the "Live Server" extension** in Visual Studio Code (if not already installed).
4. **Right-click `index.html`** and select **"Open with Live Server"**.

The app will open in your browser, displaying the weather information.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- OpenWeatherMap API
- Axios (for API requests)

## Challenges Faced
- Handling asynchronous requests to fetch data using `fetch` and `axios`.
- Managing the geolocation feature to get weather data for the user's current location.

## Solutions Implemented
- Used `axios` for better error handling in API requests.
- Handled multiple API calls for both weather and geolocation data.

Feel free to modify and enhance the app as per your requirements!
